# COMP324_Project
Our Project for Comp 324. Netflix based video application.


Emile - feb 19. Added foundation for the webpage in newest commit. I wanted to add that I placed all of these files in a src folder, and Im not sure if git will place them in such a folder when the commit is pushed. Also, to test out the webpage, I suggest downloading live share(If you're on VSCode, the IDE I'm using)
