# COMP324_Project
Our Project for Comp 324. Netflix based video application.


Emile - feb 19. Added foundation for the webpage in newest commit. I wanted to add that I placed all of these files in a src folder, and Im not sure if git will place them in such a folder when the commit is pushed. Also, to test out the webpage, I suggest downloading live share(If you're on VSCode, the IDE I'm using)


Emile - March 13. Added more stuff, fleshed out the welcome page; added a navbar and a search bar, fixed the header a bit. I also added functionality to the navbar links, but they will lead to blank pages.

as of now this is what I believe we need to do 
- making a log in/create account page
- flesh out the other pages. We can add as many as we like or change the names of the current ones, as they're just placeholder concepts.
- add functionality for thumbnails on the home page.
- I figure we really need some backend/data management support now, in order to feature content and host user information. (!!!)
