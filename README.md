# COMP324_Project
Our Project for Comp 324. Netflix based video application.


Emile - feb 19. Added foundation for the webpage in newest commit. I wanted to add that I placed all of these files in a src folder, and Im not sure if git will place them in such a folder when the commit is pushed. Also, to test out the webpage, I suggest downloading live share(If you're on VSCode, the IDE I'm using)


Emile - March 13. Added more stuff, fleshed out the welcome page; added a navbar and a search bar, fixed the header a bit. I also added functionality to the navbar links, but they will lead to blank pages.

as of now this is what I believe we need to do 
- making a log in/create account page
- flesh out the other pages. We can add as many as we like or change the names of the current ones, as they're just placeholder concepts.
- add functionality for thumbnails on the home page.
- I figure we really need some backend/data management support now, in order to feature content and host user information. (!!!)



Emile - March 17th. MongoDB has been implemented into the codebase. Two playgrounds for mongodb are going to be appended to our project. playground-1 is irrelevant, and can be ignored for now, but it can be used for testing if you want. StudentBoard is the one I hope we can really focus on in terms of breaking and testing. Once you have installed mongodb on your computer, add the extension for mongodb on VSCODE. Then, all you have to do is connect to the database using this string:

mongodb://localhost:27017

I'm not sure this will really work since its local, but I hope it will! That said, I assume that because its local, we can change all we want on our own, and upon updating the playground, the database will be properly updated. We just have to make sure we are up to date and communicating when updating the playground.
