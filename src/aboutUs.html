    <h2>Loyola University of Chicago</h2>
    <h3>Film and Digital Media</h3>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>From the acclaimed Hulu series The Bear to the religious and environmental drama of First Reformed, from Lollapalooza and Pitchfork music festivals to student podcasts like Ice Cream Social, Chicago provides the settings and the studios for an ever-growing media landscape. Loyola’s Film and Digital Media program offers the opportunity to gain real-world experiences with award-winning filmmakers, producers, programmers, publicists, game designers, reviewers, and scholars. Students collaboratively create transformative media experiences and learn the business of film, television, games, and streaming media for a variety of audiences and platforms.</p>
        <p>“I have always been interested in the creative aspect of filmmaking and the process behind making digital content, especially narrative storytelling. Over the past two years, I have worked on multiple film projects, as well as a directed study project, that have helped me to develop my skills in many aspects of filmmaking. I also recently completed a short film I co-wrote and directed for a senior project, and [gained] experience writing for television as part of a screenwriting class.”</p>
        <p><strong>---Olivia McClure, recipient of the 2023 Outstanding Student in Film and Digital Media award</strong></p>
